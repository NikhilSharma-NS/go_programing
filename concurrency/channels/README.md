### Channels

1) Communication data between Goroutines
2) synchronise Goroutines
3) Typed
4) Thread-Safe


##### Declare and Initilize

var ch chan T
ch = make(chan T)

##### <- operator

pointer operator is used for sending and receiving the value from channel

the arrow indicates the direction of data flow

Send  
```
ch <- v
```
receive

```
v = <-ch
```

ch <- value
Channel wait fro a receiver to be raedy then Channels are blocking

<-ch
Go Rountines wait for a value to se sent then Channels are blocking

##### close(ch1)

No more value to be sent


value,ok = <- ch
ok = true , value generated by a write
ok = false , value generated by a close
