Introduction:

A linked list is a linear data structure like array. whereas,linked list do not have elements stored 
in contiguous location,as arrays do.

singly linked list is a collection of nodes .Node consists of 2 parts

1) Data
2) pointer

```
  Head  
 
|Va1|Next| -> |Val2|Next| -> |Val3|Next|  -> Null

```

1) Insert Element into singly linked list

for adding a new node at the end of linked list we have to traverse through the linked list till end.

we can say head is the start of list . head is a pointer that points to the first node of list and
End is the end of the list (End is a pointer of he node that has NULL value)
