##### what is link list?

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.


Node Structure: A node in a linked list typically consists of two components:

Data: It holds the actual value or data associated with the node.
Next Pointer: It stores the memory address (reference) of the next node in the sequence.

Head and Tail: The linked list is accessed through the head node, which points to the first node in the list. The last node in the list points to NULL or nullptr, indicating the end of the list. This node is known as the tail node.
