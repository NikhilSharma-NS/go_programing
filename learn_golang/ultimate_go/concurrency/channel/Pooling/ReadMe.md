The pooling pattern uses the wait for task pattern just described. The pooling
pattern allows me to manage resource usage across a well defined number of
Goroutines. 

As explained previously, in Go pooling is not needed for efficiency in
CPU processing like at the operating system. Itâ€™s more important for efficiency in
resource usage.
